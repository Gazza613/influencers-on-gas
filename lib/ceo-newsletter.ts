const REGISTER = `TONE AND COMPLIANCE (on top of the CEO rules above, never overriding them):
- Write in the register a serious business of THIS size and category would publish under its CEO's name:
  corporate and credible, but genuinely engaging and easy to understand - never stiff, jargon-heavy or dull,
  and never flippant or salesy.
- For a licensed financial services client (a life insurer, a bank, a fintech) NOTHING may read as financial
  advice, a promise or guarantee of an outcome, or a claim that cannot be substantiated. Anything the piece
  says must survive that client's regulatory regime (for SA life cover: FSCA, FAIS, PPR). When in doubt, make
  the point about what the company stands for and what it makes possible, not about a product, a price or a
  benefit you cannot prove.
- UK British spelling. Never an em dash or an en dash.`;
